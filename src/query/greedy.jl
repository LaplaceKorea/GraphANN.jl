"""
    GreedyCallbacks

Keyword defined struct - called at different points during query execution.
Allows for arbitrary telemetry to be defined.

Fields and Signatures
---------------------

* `prequery` - Called before a single query is executed. Must take no arguments.
    Does not automatically differentiate between multithreaded and singlethreaded cases.

* `postquery` - Called after a single query is executed. Must take no arguments.
    Does not automatically differentiate between multithreaded and singlethreaded cases.

* `postdistance` - Called after distance computations for a vertex have been completed.
    Signature: `postdistance(algo::GreedySearch, neighbors::AbstractVector)`.
    - `algo` provides the current state of the search.
    - `neighbors` the adjacency list for the vertex that was just processed.
        *NOTE*: Do NOT mutate neighbors, it MUST be constant.
